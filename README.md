# NLP Project (Behold) - Team Orange

## **Business Problem:** 
A common problem for Behold is the extremely manual classification of new products into their specific brands. Behold has supplier relationships from many global clothing vendors and marketplaces, but has found that the bottleneck for scaling out the number of products they can sell is identifying the brands associated with each new product.

## **Project Goal:**
1. Build an NLP classification model to predict which brand a new product should be assigned.
2. Create a brand recommender algorithm that would recommend an outfit given a customerâ€™s search query.

## **Part 2 - Recommender Algorithm**
